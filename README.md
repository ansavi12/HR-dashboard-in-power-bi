Task Description:This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize student performance data. The dataset includes details such as Roll Number, Name, Gender, and Marks, which are transformed into meaningful insights using Power BI’s data modeling, DAX, and visualization features.

The dashboard enables users to explore overall academic performance, gender-wise trends, and pass–fail distributions through dynamic charts, KPI cards, and filters. By applying business intelligence techniques, the project demonstrates how raw data can be converted into actionable insights to support educational decision-making.

Key features of the dashboard include:

Automated Pass/Fail classification using calculated DAX columns

KPI cards for total students, average marks, and highest score

Interactive filters (slicers) for gender and marks

Visual analysis using bar charts, column charts, pie charts, and tables

This project showcases practical skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX, and dashboard design, making it suitable for academic projects, internships, and data analytics portfolios.
